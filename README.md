## General info
This project/app is created to help people budget their money to help them manage their expenses so they can save money to get out of debt, buy something nice or maybe even plan for retirement. Once at the landing page the user is able to create and account to store they're budgeting information. Once logged in, the application allows the user to enter their income for the month as well as their expenses for the month. Once the information is inputted the user will be able to see how much money they are utilizing and how much they can save each month. To help illustrate this we've provided graphs to visualize the users budget and savings.
